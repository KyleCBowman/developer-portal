NFT-MAKER PRO is a toolset consisting of a web app and accompanying API that enables you to create, manage, and sell NFTs at scale on the Cardano blockchain.
It has been built to empower projects of all sizes with a smooth sales and distribution process - designed to remove as much technical complexity as possible.

The process essentially works by allowing project creators to pre-load their NFTs into NFT-MAKER.
Creators can then copy-paste our Industry Leading PaymentGateway onto their website, allowing their community to purchase the NFTs.
NFT-MAKER handles everything else.

## Link your Payout Wallet

An external wallet (payout wallet) is your personal custodial wallet which you must specify in your project in order to receive the funds of your sales.
This can be done in 30 seconds by submitting the wallet address and then accepting the confirmation email.

## Create your project

Now that we have at least 1 External Payout Wallet submitted, we can create your NFT project!
At this stage, you need to add the details, confirm when you want the PolicyID to expire and configure your Metadata Template.

## Upload your NFT art/media

With the project ready, we then need to upload your art or other media.
We support most file types from 3D assets to PNG images, Video files to PDFs.

We offer various solutions for uploading media, most commonly people use the SFTP file server which allows for drag-and-drop file uploading thousands of images in one go.
There is also a webapp/UI interface where small project creators can upload a single NFT.
More technical creators may prefer to use our API.

## Upload your NFT Metadata

With the art/media now loaded, you can then upload your Metadata through a variety of methods.
If you already have it in the JSON format, this can be loaded in the same SFTP drag-and-drop method.
We also offer a single CSV file upload for those that are more familiar with spreadsheet software.
